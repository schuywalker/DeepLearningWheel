# Leveraging LSTM Stock Price Predictions With Options

Authors: Schuyler Asplin, Vlad Shingarey, Parker Groop

This project is broken into 2 main parts:

1. Using Long Short Term Memory to attempt stock price prediction
2. Attempting to find a buy-side, option-based strategy that achieves better average returns than using LSTM to bet on the shares (or similar returns with reduced risk).

# Part 1: Predicting Price

Result of our price predictions are below in orange, with the actual price in blue:
