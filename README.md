# Leveraging LSTM Stock Price Predictions With Options

Authors: Schuyler Asplin, Vlad Shingarey, Parker Groop 

This project is broken into 2 main parts:
1) Using Long Short Term Memory to attempt stock price prediction
2) Attempting to find a buy-side, option-based strategy that achieves better average returns than using LSTM to bet on the shares (or similar returns with reduced risk).
